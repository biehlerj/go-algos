[Selection sort algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) implemented in Go.

## Performance

Worst-case Performance: $O(n^2)$ comparisons, $O(n)$ swaps

Best-case Performance: $O(n^2)$ comparisons, $O(1)$ swap

Average Performance: $O(n^2)$ comparisons, $O(n)$ swaps

Worst-case space complexity: $O(1)$ auxiliary
